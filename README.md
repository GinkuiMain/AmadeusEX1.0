# AmadeusEX1.0
The PUBLIC version of Amadeus! ( With many WIP things :/ )
I plan on making a C# variant, as I find C# more interesting for projects like this.


-> Made to interact with users. Music command has been added! Although, only plays 3 songs... I need to find a way to stream music from open-source websites or sources.

WIP Using: Python 3.10.6, Py-Cord, Discord.py, PyNaCl, FFmPeg
