# AmadeusEX1.0
The PUBLIC version of Amadeus! ( With many WIP things :/ )


-> Before you even decide to ask, YES. This is a project I've been doing for fun, to mess around with Python. I plan on making a C# version, since I genuinely prefer C#. But, I'd need to either find a good package to connect to the application, or, reinvent the wheel and make it myself (which surely would be hard, for me at least.) - And I'm afraid of exposing my token.
