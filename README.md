# AmadeusEX1.0
The PUBLIC version of Amadeus! ( With many WIP things :/ )
I plan on making a C# variant, as I find C# more interesting for projects like this.


-> Made to interact with users. Currently trying to add a play music command, but figuring out on how to do it.  Discord bot that, based ona user's input, will pick up the name of the song, search for it on YouTube and play it for the voice chat

WIP Using: Python 3.10.6, Py-Cord, Discord.py, PyNaCl
